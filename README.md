Calculus   Honors   Quarter   1 Project
Background:
This project will   be a   large-scale project which will   count   as   15%   of your   quarter   grade.   This   should   be taken very seriously and academic honesty   is of the   upmost   importance.   Workdone   should   be   your   own. You   are   expected   to   work   on   these   individually   and   follow   all   required   guidelines. Academic   Dishonesty of any   kind   is not tolerated and   will   be   given   a   0   for   the   grade.   Due Beginning of Class Friday Oct 11.   Late submissions will not   be accepted.
Purpose:
This project   is aimed to   help you gain   in-depth   knowledge of the   continuity and   differentiability   of functions. Limits and differentiation are two   critical topics   in   Calculus   which   have   numerous real world applications.
This project will require research,   critical thinking,   application   of   knowledge,   calculation,   creativity, and the use of technology. You will   be   asked   to   design   a   roller   coaster   using   a   piece-   wise function with at   least 6 functions that   is   everywhere   continuous and   differentiable,   and create an A3   poster   of your   design.
Part   One: Design   a   Roller   Coaster
You   willcreate   a   design   for   a   rollercoaster. You   must:
1.       Use at   least 6 piece-wise functions   which   includes   at least 3 function types   among the   following: polynomials, root, rational, trigonometric (and   obviously   others   as you   wish!)
2.      Show all calculations to   prove
a.       Functions are   continuous
b.      Functions are differentiable
3.      Write the complete piece-wise function that   represents the   entire   roller   coaster   path.
4.      The roller coaster should start and end with   a   horizontal   line   which   must   be   equal   (loading   area).
*Note: Loading   area is not part   of   the piece-wise   functions (in   terms   of   differentiability).
5.      Use desmos (or any equivalent graphing software/application as you   like)   to   draw   the   2D   representation of the roller   coaster.<代 写Calculus Honors Quarter 1 ProjectR

Part   Two: Create   an   A3   poster   of   the   Roller   Coaster
You   willcreate   an   A3poster   ofthe   rollercoaster. You   must   include   the   following   information:
1.    Label   the   different   pieces   of   the   roller   coaster.
2.    For each piece,   label the   function   that   is   selected.
3.    Explain why those functions where chosen   (as   in   how they   play   a   role   in your   Roller   Coaster).
4.    Name the   roller coaster!
5.   Clearly show your calculations for functions   being continuous and differentiable   at   the   points   where the   pieces   meet.
6.    At the minimum your graph of the   roller coaster   should   be   colorful   (each   piece   should   be   a
different color), and display all required   information.   Bonus   points will   be   rewarded   (see   rubrics   below) for visually pleasing and neat graphs,   whether   it’s   hand-made   or   printed.
7.    Flexibility   in general   is encouraged,   if there   is anything else that you   deem   fit   to   be   added   to   the   poster, feel free   to   do   so.
